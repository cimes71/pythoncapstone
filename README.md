# pythoncapstone

This was the Python capstone course taken several years ago.  Parsed the Texas DOJ page that contained links to everyone put to death in Texas and parsed the last words for patterns and stored these for display in a word map.  Also collected infromation on the inmates including Male/Female and other data for future use where it could be parsed.

Used Beautiful Soup for the HTML parsing, SQL Lite for the database.
